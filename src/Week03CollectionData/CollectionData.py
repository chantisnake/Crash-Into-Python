# String

def string_sample():
    """Some sample code for python string

    """
    # python string behaves almost exactly like lists

    # you can index it
    first_letter = "abc"[0]  # first letter will be "a"

    # you can iterate over it
    a = [letter for letter in "abc"]  # `a` will be a list ["a", "b", "c"]

    # there are some special method defined on them
    # here is some really useful ones

    # `split` method
    # the `split` method splits the string.
    # by default, it splits all the white space
    # therefore `a` will equal to ["a", "quick", "fox"]
    a = "a quick fox".split()
    # we can tell the method what to split on
    # then `a` will be equal to ['We must know', ' We will know', '']
    a = "We must know. We will know.".split(".")

    # IMPORTANT:
    # `split` is a "method" on string
    # "method" behaves almost like functions (with subtle difference), it is just different syntax.
    # but if you call `split("We must know. We will know.", ".")` python will give you an error
    # since `split` is defined as a method, therefore you cannot use it as a function.

    # Here is the difference between method and function (rather technical, but not that important)
    # method can make change to the value in front of them, for example:
    # `res.append("test")` will change the value in `res`
    # however, many method choose not to change the value in the front, like:
    # `string.spilt()` will not change the value stored in `string`
    # Function can change the value in its input, but only under very specific circumstances
    # for example the input is a list.
    # Python has messy design on when the function can change its input, I recommend you not to worry about it.

    # `strip` method
    # by default strip method removes start and ending spaces
    # so `a` will be "test"
    a = "  test    ".strip()

    # we can let them remove some start and ending character if we want
    # it will remove all combination of the character in the input string
    # in this case strip will remove :
    #   - all the start and ending "s"s,
    #   - all the start and ending " "s,
    #
    # `a` will be equal to   "test" (notice the inner "s" will not be removed)
    a = "s ss s   test s ss ss".strip("s ")

    # `join` method
    # `join` method will join a list of string with some string
    # it behaves kind of like the inverse operation of split method
    # in here `a` will equal "a quick fox"
    # `b` will equal "aquickfox"
    a = " ".join(["a", "quick", "fox"])
    b = "".join(["a", "quick", "fox"])

    # `startswith` and `endswith` method
    # they test if a string start with some string or ends with some string
    a = "a quick fox".startswith("aquick")  # `a` will be false
    b = "a quick fox".endswith("k fox")  # `b` will be true

    # These are not all the methods on string, but just some useful ones

# this bug takes us a long time to find, mostly because it is hard to reproduce,
# since you need more than 10 files to trigger this bug,
# and during testing we want minimal example, and rarely sent too many files into the program
# also when you perform the operation on any file with id like "1", "5", "9",
# it behaves totally normal.

# we noticed that `operation_on_file` takes a string as input,
# and `operation_on_files` takes a list as input.
# then if we specified the type of the input, we will save us so much trouble:

# FINAL CONCLUSION:
#
# - List
#   - Construction
#       - explicit construction, like `[1, 2, 3]`
#       - can be generated using list comprehension
#   - Property and constrain:
#       - Ordered collection (can be sliced and indexed)
#   - Important methods:
#       - count (`a.count(1)`, this will count how many 1 in `a`)
#       - all the other method will mutate some value, therefore are all not recommended to use
#   - Fast to
#       - index (`a[2]`,
#               you can use negative number to index the last elements: `a[-2]` will give you the second last element)
#       - slice (`a[0:1]`,
#                `a[:-1]` will give you all the element except the last one)
#       - append element at end (most of the time)
#       - remove element at end
#   - Slow to
#       - determine if a element is in it (`a in [1,2, 3]`)
#       - remove element in the middle
#       - insert element in the middle
#
# - String
#   - Construction
#       - explicit construction, like `"test"`
#   - Property and constrain:
#       - Ordered collection (can be sliced and indexed)
#   - Important methods
#       - split
#       - strip
#       - join
#       - startswith and endswith (test if a string starts with or ends with a certain string)
#   - performance-wise exactly the same as a list
#
# - Generator
#   - Construction
#       - can be generated using generator comprehension
#   - Property and constrain:
#       - Ordered collection, but cannot be sliced or indexed
#       - but disappears after being iterated over (basically apply any operation on it will change its value)
#       - Good rule of thumb is not to assign name to it
#   - Memory efficient
#   - No method that are useful, this is basically a memory efficient alternative to list
#       - generator is useful to construct one use lists. (see example in generator and frozen set)
#
# - Dict
#   - Construction
#       - explicit construction, like  `{1: "test", 2: "test2"}`
#       - dict comprehension
#   - Property and constrain:
#       - unordered collection, cannot be sliced, but can be indexed using key
#       - keys needs to be distinct
#       - key needs to be "hashable" (basically means immutable at this point),
#           This means list, set, dict cannot be used as key, but frozenset, string, int, tuple can.
#       - no constrain on values, anything can be a value.
#   - Important Methods:
#       - keys (get all the keys)
#       - values (get all the values)
#       - items (get the keys and corresponding value paired in tuple)
#   - Fast to (basically everything going from key is fast)
#       - Find the value via key
#       - change a value of a key
#       - insert a new corresponding key and value
#       - remove a corresponding key and value (if given a key)
#   - Slow to
#       - determine if a value or key is in the dict
#       - change the key of a value
#
# - Set (frozen set)
#   - Construction
#       - explicit construction, like `{1, 2}` or `frozenset({1, 2})`, `frozenset([1,2])`
#       - set comprehension or the function `frozenset` followed by a generator comprehension
#   - Property and constrain:
#       - unordered collection, cannot be sliced or indexed
#       - elements needs to be distinct
#       - elements needs to be "hashable" (basically means immutable at this point),
#           This means list, set, dict cannot be set elements, but frozenset, string, int, tuple can.
#   - important method:
#       - union
#       - intersection
#       - there are other useful method, but they will mutate the a value, therefore not recommended.
#   - Fast to (basically everything is fast,
#     but `set` is a very weak structure with many constrains, like all the element has to be distinct)
#       - determine if a element is in the set (`1 in {1, 2}`)
#       - insert element
#       - delete element
#   - Slow to: Not that I can think of
